## Generations

### First Generation (A1, 1979-1984)
The first generation Jetta was essentially a sedan version of the Golf, featuring angular styling and sharing most of the Golf's mechanical components. It was powered by a range of engines including 1.1L, 1.3L, 1.5L, 1.6L, and 1.8L gasoline options, as well as a 1.6L diesel. The Jetta quickly became popular for offering a more premium alternative to the Golf hatchback.

### Second Generation (A2, 1984-1992)
The second generation grew in size and sophistication, with more rounded styling. Engine options expanded to include more powerful variants, with displacement ranging from 1.3L to 2.0L for gasoline engines and 1.6L to 1.9L for diesels. The GTX and GLI performance variants were introduced during this generation, enhancing the Jetta's sporty image.

### Third Generation (A3, 1992-1999)
The third generation Jetta featured more aerodynamic styling and improved build quality. Engine options included 1.6L to 2.8L VR6 gasoline engines and 1.9L diesel engines, including the introduction of Volkswagen's TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) technology. Safety features were significantly improved with the addition of airbags and ABS.

### Fourth Generation (A4, 1999-2006)
The fourth generation Jetta adopted a more upscale appearance with a rounded design. This generation offered a range of engines from a 1.4L to a 2.8L VR6, along with 1.9L TDI diesel options. It featured improved interior quality and introduced more advanced technology, including electronic stability control in later models.

### Fifth Generation (A5, 2005-2011)
The fifth generation marked a significant redesign with a more upscale appearance and larger dimensions. Engine options included 1.4L to 2.5L gasoline engines and the continued evolution of the 1.9L and later 2.0L TDI diesel engines. This generation introduced DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions and more sophisticated electronic features.

### Sixth Generation (A6, 2011-2018)
The sixth generation Jetta grew even larger and was specifically designed to appeal to the North American market, with different specifications than European models. Engine options included a 1.2L to 2.0L gasoline engines, a 2.0L TDI diesel, and a hybrid version in some markets. This generation was more cost-effective but initially received criticism for interior quality compared to its predecessor.

### Seventh Generation (A7, 2018-present)
The seventh generation Jetta moved to Volkswagen's MQB platform, featuring a more dynamic design and significantly improved technology. Engine options include efficient 1.4L and 1.5L TSI turbocharged gasoline engines and the sporty 2.0L TSI in the GLI variant. This generation emphasizes digital technology with a configurable digital cockpit, advanced driver assistance systems, and improved connectivity features.
