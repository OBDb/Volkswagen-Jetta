generations:
  - name: "First Generation (A1, Type 16)"
    start_year: 1979
    end_year: 1984
    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Jetta was essentially a Golf with a conventional trunk, developed to appeal to markets (particularly North America) where sedans were preferred over hatchbacks. Built on the same A1 platform as the Golf, the Jetta shared most components forward of the C-pillar but featured unique sheet metal from the A-pillar back, creating a more formal three-box sedan design with a spacious 14 cubic foot trunk. Available primarily in two and four-door sedan configurations, the original Jetta featured clean, angular styling typical of the period, highlighted by rectangular headlights and a simple, straight-lined appearance. Engine options varied by market but typically included a range of four-cylinder gasoline engines from 1.1 to 1.8 liters and diesel variants from 1.6 to 1.8 liters, paired with manual or automatic transmissions driving the front wheels. The interior was virtually identical to the Golf with a straightforward, functional layout and materials ranging from basic cloth to more upscale velour or optional leatherette depending on trim level. While initially conceived as a niche model, the Jetta quickly grew in popularity, particularly in the United States where it appealed to buyers seeking European driving dynamics and build quality in a more traditional sedan format than the Golf hatchback."

  - name: "Second Generation (A2, Type 16/19/1G)"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 1992
    description: "The second-generation Volkswagen Jetta grew in size, sophistication, and market presence, continuing the formula of sharing platform and components with the Golf but with a traditional sedan body style. Built on the A2 platform shared with the second-generation Golf, the Jetta maintained similar styling forward of the C-pillar but featured a more aerodynamic overall design with softer edges and improved proportions compared to its predecessor. Available in two and four-door sedan configurations, with the latter gaining popularity as the primary body style in most markets, the second-generation Jetta featured a larger greenhouse with improved visibility and a spacious 17 cubic foot trunk. Engine options expanded to include a wider range of four-cylinder gasoline engines from 1.3 to 2.0 liters, including fuel-injected and 16-valve variants in higher trims, plus a range of diesel options including both naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior saw significant improvements in material quality, ergonomics, and available features, with higher trims offering power windows, air conditioning, and enhanced audio systems—luxury features for a compact car of this era. The second-generation Jetta achieved substantially increased sales globally, establishing itself as a legitimate standalone model rather than simply a Golf variant, particularly in North America where it became Volkswagen's best-selling model and developed a reputation for offering near-premium European characteristics at a more accessible price point than luxury brands."

  - name: "Third Generation (A3, Type 1H)"
    start_year: 1992
    end_year: 1999
    description: "The third-generation Volkswagen Jetta represented a more significant design departure from the Golf than previous generations, featuring distinct styling and a more upscale positioning. Built on the A3 platform shared with the third-generation Golf, the Jetta (known as the Vento in European markets) adopted more rounded, aerodynamic styling in keeping with 1990s design trends, with a sleeker profile, softer edges, and a more integrated appearance than its predecessors. Available primarily as a four-door sedan, with the two-door variant discontinued in most markets, the third-generation Jetta featured a slightly larger body with improved interior space and a 14 cubic foot trunk. Engine options varied significantly by market but typically included four-cylinder gasoline engines from 1.6 to 2.0 liters, VR6 six-cylinder engines in higher trims, and diesel options including the innovative TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) technology that would become a hallmark of Volkswagen diesels. Transmission choices included manual, automatic, and the new four-speed electronically controlled automatic. The interior saw improvements in design, material quality, and features, with options including power windows, air conditioning, sunroof, and ABS brakes becoming more common, while safety features expanded to include dual front airbags in most markets. This generation continued the Jetta's trajectory toward a more premium positioning within the compact segment, offering sophisticated engineering and driving dynamics compared to mainstream competitors while maintaining a price point below luxury brands, further establishing its distinct identity from the Golf despite their shared platform."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (A4, Type 1J)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The fourth-generation Volkswagen Jetta represented a substantial upgrade in quality, refinement, and sophistication, reflecting Volkswagen's broader move upmarket under Ferdinand Piëch's leadership. Built on the A4 platform shared with the fourth-generation Golf, the Jetta (known as the Bora in many European markets) featured more distinct styling from its hatchback sibling than ever before, with only the hood and front fenders shared between the models. The design emphasized quality and precision with clean lines, excellent panel fit, and a solid, substantial appearance that belied its compact segment classification. Available exclusively as a four-door sedan in most markets (though a station wagon variant was offered in some regions), the fourth-generation Jetta featured increased dimensions with improved interior space and a generous 17 cubic foot trunk. Engine options expanded further to include a wide range of four-cylinder gasoline engines from 1.6 to 2.0 liters, a 2.8-liter VR6 in higher trims, and enhanced TDI diesel options, paired with manual, automatic, or the new Tiptronic semi-automatic transmissions. The interior represented a significant advancement with premium materials, outstanding build quality, and sophisticated design that rivaled luxury brands, offering features like automatic climate control, leather upholstery, premium audio systems, and enhanced safety features including side airbags. This generation firmly established the Jetta as a near-premium offering within the compact sedan segment, particularly in North America where it continued as Volkswagen's best-selling model, appealing to buyers seeking European driving dynamics and quality in a practical, relatively affordable package."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (A5, Type 1K)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2010
    description: "The fifth-generation Volkswagen Jetta marked a significant shift in the model's product strategy, moving to a unique platform separate from the Golf for the first time and focusing more specifically on the preferences of the North American market where the model had achieved its greatest success. Built on the PQ35 platform (shared with other Volkswagen Group products but not directly with the contemporary Golf), the Jetta grew substantially larger than its predecessor, moving to the upper end of the compact segment with dimensions approaching mid-size classification in some markets. The design featured clean, somewhat conservative styling with clear references to larger Volkswagen sedans like the Passat, presenting a mature, substantial appearance distinct from the more youthful Golf. Available as a four-door sedan in all markets, with a wagon variant (essentially a Golf Variant/SportWagen with Jetta front styling) offered in some regions, the fifth-generation Jetta featured a spacious interior with rear seat room comparable to many mid-size sedans and a generous 16 cubic foot trunk. Engine options varied significantly by market but typically included a range of four and five-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines, with North American models featuring 2.0-liter naturally aspirated, 2.0-liter turbocharged, 2.5-liter five-cylinder, and later 2.0-liter TDI options, paired with manual or automatic transmissions, including the increasingly popular DSG dual-clutch automatic in some configurations. The interior maintained Volkswagen's reputation for quality materials and construction, with available features including automatic climate control, leather upholstery, navigation systems, and premium audio. This generation continued the Jetta's trajectory as a more premium alternative to mainstream compact sedans, particularly in North America where its European design and driving characteristics distinguished it from Japanese and American competitors."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (A6, Type 5C)"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The sixth-generation Volkswagen Jetta represented a strategic repositioning of the model, particularly in North America, with a focus on reduced cost and more competitive pricing against mainstream compact sedans. Built on a revised version of the PQ35 platform, the Jetta grew slightly larger again but featured simplified suspension design (with a less sophisticated torsion beam rear suspension replacing the independent setup in base models in many markets), less expensive interior materials, and fewer standard features compared to its predecessor—changes that drew criticism from some traditional Volkswagen enthusiasts but enabled more aggressive pricing. The exterior design featured clean, crisp styling that maintained Volkswagen's design language but with less distinctive character than some previous generations. Available primarily as a four-door sedan, with a wagon variant marketed separately as the Jetta SportWagen in North America and Golf Variant in other markets (actually based on the Golf platform rather than the Jetta sedan), the sixth-generation Jetta offered a spacious interior and a generous 15.5 cubic foot trunk. Engine options varied by market but typically included a range of four-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines, with North American models featuring 2.0-liter naturally aspirated, 1.8 and 2.0-liter turbocharged, 2.5-liter five-cylinder, and 2.0-liter TDI options until the diesel emissions scandal led to the discontinuation of TDI models. Transmission choices included manual, conventional automatic, and DSG dual-clutch automatic depending on engine and trim level. The interior quality improved throughout the generation, with early criticisms leading to enhancements in materials and features in subsequent model years, while a significant refresh in 2015 brought styling updates, improved technology, and the return of an independent rear suspension across all trims in most markets. This generation represented a transitional period for the Jetta as Volkswagen sought to balance the model's traditional near-premium positioning with the need for more competitive pricing in key markets, a challenge that would be more comprehensively addressed by its successor."

  - name: "Seventh Generation (A7)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: null
    description: "The seventh-generation Volkswagen Jetta represents a comprehensive redesign built on the company's modern MQB platform shared with numerous other Volkswagen Group products, including the Golf, allowing for improved proportions, enhanced technology, and more sophisticated driving dynamics while maintaining competitive pricing. Featuring more expressive styling than its predecessor with a coupe-like roofline, prominent character lines, and a wider stance, the latest Jetta projects a more dynamic, contemporary appearance while maintaining a distinctly Volkswagen identity. Slightly larger than the previous generation in most dimensions, the sedan offers enhanced interior space with comfortable accommodations for five passengers and a 14.1 cubic foot trunk. In most markets, particularly North America where the Jetta remains most popular, power comes from a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (upgraded to 1.5-liter from 2022) producing approximately 147 horsepower, paired with either a six-speed manual (discontinued in some regions after 2021) or eight-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The interior features a driver-oriented design with a standard 6.5-inch (later 8-inch) touchscreen infotainment system, available digital instrument cluster (Digital Cockpit), and enhanced connectivity options including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on later models. Material quality and available features represent a significant improvement over the early sixth-generation models, with options including leather upholstery, ventilated seats, panoramic sunroof, BeatsAudio premium sound system, and comprehensive driver assistance technology. A high-performance GLI variant continues, offering a 228-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, sport suspension with independent multi-link rear setup (versus the standard torsion beam), and enhanced brakes. A mid-cycle refresh for 2022 brought updated styling, the aforementioned engine upgrade, enhanced technology, and additional features. The seventh-generation Jetta successfully balances the need for competitive pricing in the shrinking sedan segment with the driving dynamics and quality expected of the Volkswagen brand, offering a distinctive alternative to mainstream compact sedans while adapting to changing market conditions that have seen many competitors abandon the segment entirely."
